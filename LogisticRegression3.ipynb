    "Precision and recall are two important metrics used to evaluate the performance of classification models, especially in binary classification tasks. These metrics are often used when the focus is on understanding the quality of predictions for one of the classes, usually the positive class (often labeled as 1), in scenarios where imbalanced datasets or differing class costs are important considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision:\n",
    "Definition: Precision measures the accuracy of positive predictions made by the model. It answers the question: \"Of all the instances that the model predicted as positive, how many were actually positive?\"\n",
    "Formula: Precision = True Positives (TP) / (True Positives (TP) + False Positives (FP))\n",
    "Interpretation: High precision means that when the model predicts an instance as positive, it is likely to be correct. It minimizes the rate of false positives (Type I errors). High precision is essential when false positives are costly or undesirable.\n",

    "Recall (Sensitivity or True Positive Rate):\n",
    "Definition: Recall measures the ability of the model to identify all actual positive instances in the dataset. It answers the question: \"Of all the instances that are actually positive, how many did the model correctly predict as positive?\"\n",
    "Formula: Recall = True Positives (TP) / (True Positives (TP) + False Negatives (FN))\n",
    "Interpretation: High recall indicates that the model is effective at capturing most of the actual positive instances. It minimizes the rate of false negatives (Type II errors). High recall is important when missing positive instances is costly or unacceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trade-off between precision and recall is often observed. When you increase precision, you may reduce recall, and vice versa. This trade-off can be managed by adjusting the model's classification threshold. Lowering the threshold tends to increase recall but decrease precision, while raising the threshold does the opposite.\n",
    "It's essential to choose between precision and recall depending on the specific requirements and objectives of your classification problem. For example, in medical diagnoses, where false positives can be costly, you might prioritize precision. In information retrieval, where not missing relevant documents is crucial, you might prioritize recall. "

    "A higher AUC indicates that the model has better discrimination power in distinguishing between the two classes. It provides a single scalar value to compare the overall performance of different models.\n",
